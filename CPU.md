# CPU

## Step 1: Verify Compatibility

    Refer to Motherboard Manual: Confirm that the CPU you have is compatible with your motherboard. Check the motherboard manual for a list of supported CPUs.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Workspace

    Open CPU Socket: Locate the CPU socket on the motherboard and lift the retention arm.

## Step 3: Install the CPU

    Identify CPU Orientation: Examine the CPU for notches or markings that indicate its correct orientation. Align these with the corresponding features on the CPU socket.

    Gently Lower the CPU: Hold the CPU by the edges and lower it into the socket without applying any force. Ensure it sits flat.

    Secure the Retention Arm: Carefully lower the retention arm to secure the CPU in place. It may require a little pressure, but avoid excessive force.

## Step 4: Apply Thermal Paste (if necessary)

    Check Cooler Instructions: If your CPU cooler requires thermal paste, refer to the cooler's instructions for the appropriate application method.

    Apply Thermal Paste: Place a small, pea-sized amount of thermal paste onto the center of the CPU. If your cooler has a pre-applied thermal pad, skip this step.

## Step 5: Install CPU Cooler

    Refer to Cooler Manual: Follow the instructions in the CPU cooler manual for proper installation.

    Align Cooler Mounting Brackets: Align the cooler's mounting brackets with the corresponding holes around the CPU socket.

    Secure Cooler: Use the provided screws or clips to secure the CPU cooler in place. Tighten them in a crisscross pattern to ensure even pressure.

## Step 6: Connect Cooler to Motherboard

    Connect Fan Cable: Connect the CPU cooler fan cable to the CPU fan header on the motherboard.

## Step 7: Cable Management

    Route Cables: Neatly route the CPU cooler cables to avoid interference with other components. Use cable ties for tidy cable management.

    Congratulations! You've successfully installed the CPU and cooler, a critical step in building your custom PC. In the following steps, you'll continue to add components such as storage, graphics card, power supply, and more.
