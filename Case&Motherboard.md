# Motherboard

Welcome to the first step in the PC building tutorial!

## Step 1: Gather Your Tools

Before diving into the case installation, make sure you have all the necessary tools on hand. This typically includes a screwdriver (usually Phillips-head) and zip ties for cable management.

## Step 2: Prepare the Case

    Unbox the Case: Carefully unpack the case and ensure that all accessories and screws are included. Place the case on a clean, flat surface.

    Inspect the Interior: Take a look inside the case to familiarize yourself with the layout. Identify key components such as the motherboard tray, drive bays, and cable management areas.

## Step 3: Install the Standoffs

    Locate the Standoff Positions: Identify the standoff positions on the case's motherboard tray. These are small raised mounts that align with the screw holes on your motherboard.

    Install Standoffs: Using a standoff tool or your fingers, install the standoffs into the designated positions. Make sure they are tightened securely but not overly so.

## Step 4: Place the I/O Shield

    Identify the I/O Shield Slot: Locate the rectangular cutout on the back of the case. This is where the motherboard's I/O shield will be installed.

    Insert the I/O Shield: Carefully snap the I/O shield into the slot from the inside of the case. Ensure that it is securely in place, with the ports aligned properly.

## Step 5: Position the Motherboard

    Align the Screw Holes: Gently place the motherboard on the standoffs, aligning the pre-installed I/O shield with the motherboard ports. Make sure the screw holes on the motherboard align with the standoffs.

    Secure the Motherboard: Use the screws provided with the case to secure the motherboard to the standoffs. Start with the corners and then proceed to the remaining screws. Be cautious not to overtighten.

## Step 6: Cable Management

    Organize Cables: Begin organizing and routing cables through the designated cable management channels. Use zip ties to secure cables and keep the interior tidy.

    Connect Front Panel Cables: Connect the front panel cables (power button, reset button, LEDs, etc.) to the corresponding headers on the motherboard. Refer to the motherboard manual for specific instructions.

    It is important to start cable management early because it can get out of control quickly. Always ensure you are routing cables efficiently to keep track of what is connected.



Congratulations! You've successfully installed your motherboard into the case. This foundational step sets the stage for the assembly of the rest of your PC components.
