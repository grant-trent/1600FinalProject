# Connecting Cables

If you saved connecting all the parts together for the end, then this portion is for you. If you have already connected all parts, then you may skip this step.

## Step 1: Organize Cables

    Untangle and Sort Cables: Untangle any cables that may have become twisted during the installation process. Sort them to make it easier to identify and connect each cable.

## Step 2: Connect Front Panel Cables

    Refer to Motherboard Manual: Consult the motherboard manual to identify the front panel connectors on the motherboard.

    Connect Power Switch and Reset Switch: Connect the power switch and reset switch cables from the case to the corresponding headers on the motherboard. Observe the polarity, as these connectors are often polarized.

    Connect Power LED and HDD LED: Connect the power LED and HDD LED cables to their respective headers on the motherboard. Pay attention to the positive (+) and negative (-) pins.

## Step 3: Connect USB and Audio Cables

    Connect USB Headers: If your case has front USB ports, connect the USB headers to the corresponding USB headers on the motherboard.

    Connect Audio Headers: Connect the front panel audio cable to the audio header on the motherboard.

## Step 4: Connect Additional Cables

    Connect SATA Data Cables: Connect SATA data cables from the motherboard to the respective SATA ports on your storage devices (SSD/HDD).

    Connect SATA Power Cables: Ensure that the SATA power cables are connected to the power supply and the corresponding power connectors on your storage devices.

    Connect PCIe Cables: If your graphics card requires additional power, connect the PCIe power cables from the power supply to the graphics card.

## Step 5: Cable Management

    Route and Secure Cables: Neatly route and secure cables using cable ties or Velcro straps. This not only improves aesthetics but also helps with airflow and cooling.

## Step 6: Double-Check Connections

    Verify All Connections: Before powering on the system, double-check all cable connections to ensure they are secure and properly seated.

## Step 7: Close the Case

    Secure Side Panels: If you haven't already, secure the side panels of the case using the provided screws.

    Final Checks: Conduct a final visual inspection to ensure all components are securely installed, and cables are correctly connected.

Congratulations! You've successfully connected all necessary cables in your PC. In the final step, you'll power on the system and begin the initial setup.
