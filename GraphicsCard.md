## Step 1: Choose a Compatible Graphics Card

    Refer to Motherboard Manual: Check the motherboard manual to identify the PCIe slots and their compatibility with your chosen graphics card.

    Select Graphics Card: Choose a graphics card that fits within your case and is compatible with your power supply.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Workspace

    Identify PCIe Slot: Locate the PCIe slot on the motherboard where you'll install the graphics card.

## Step 3: Install the Graphics Card

    Open PCIe Slot: If there is a protective cover on the PCIe slot, remove it by gently pressing down on the latch and pulling it to the side.

    Align the Card: Align the graphics card with the PCIe slot, ensuring that the PCIe connector on the card matches the slot on the motherboard.

    Install the Card: Firmly but gently press down on the graphics card until you hear a click, indicating that it is securely in place. The PCIe slot latch should engage.

    Secure the Card: Use screws to secure the graphics card bracket to the case, if required.

## Step 4: Connect Power to the Graphics Card

    Locate PCIe Power Connectors: Most graphics cards require additional power. Connect the PCIe power cables from the power supply to the corresponding connectors on the graphics card.

## Step 5: Cable Management

    Route Cables: Neatly route the graphics card power cables to avoid interference with other components. Use cable ties for tidy cable management.

    Final Checks: Before moving on to the next step, ensure that the graphics card is securely installed, power cables are connected, and the PCIe slot latch is engaged.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed the graphics card in your PC, adding the capability for high-performance graphics and gaming. In the subsequent steps, you'll continue by adding the power supply and finally powering on the system.
