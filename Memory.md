# Memory

## Step 1: Choose Memory Modules

    Refer to Motherboard Manual: Check your motherboard manual for information on the supported memory types, speeds, and recommended configurations.

    Select Memory Modules: Choose the RAM modules that meet your system requirements. Ensure they are compatible with your motherboard and CPU.

## Step 2: Install Memory Modules

    Unlock DIMM Slots: If your motherboard has latches on the DIMM slots, unlock them by pushing them outward.

    Align the Notch: Examine the memory module for a notch along the connector. Align this notch with the notch on the DIMM slot.

    Install the Memory: Gently but firmly press down on both ends of the memory module until the latches click into place. Apply even pressure to ensure proper seating.

    Repeat for Additional Modules: If you have more than one memory module, repeat the process for each additional module, following the motherboard's recommended configuration for dual-channel or quad-channel setups.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

    Check Clips: Ensure that the latches on both ends of the memory modules are securely locked into place.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed memory modules into your motherboard. This step significantly contributes to your system's performance and multitasking capabilities. In the subsequent steps, you'll continue building your custom PC by adding the CPU, storage, graphics card, and more.
