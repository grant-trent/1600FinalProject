# Power Supply

## Step 1: Choose a Compatible Power Supply

    Refer to Case and Component Requirements: Check your case and component requirements to determine the form factor and wattage of the power supply needed.

    Select Power Supply: Choose a power supply unit (PSU) that meets the required wattage, is compatible with your case, and has the necessary connectors for your components.

## Step 2: Install the Power Supply

    Locate the Power Supply Mounting Area: Identify the power supply mounting area in the case. In many cases, this is at the bottom, but it can vary.

    Insert the Power Supply: Slide the power supply into the mounting area with the fan facing downward (if the case has a bottom-mounted PSU).

    Secure the Power Supply: Use the provided screws to secure the power supply to the case. Tighten the screws evenly to ensure a secure fit.

## Step 3: Connect Power Cables

    Connect Main Motherboard Power Cable (24-pin): Connect the 24-pin main motherboard power cable from the power supply to the corresponding 24-pin connector on the motherboard.

    Connect CPU Power Cable (4/8-pin): Connect the 4/8-pin CPU power cable from the power supply to the CPU power connector on the motherboard.

    Connect GPU Power Cables (if applicable): If your graphics card requires additional power, connect the PCIe power cables from the power supply to the graphics card.

    Connect SATA/Molex Cables: Connect the SATA/Molex power cables from the power supply to the respective drives and peripherals.

## Step 4: Cable Management

    Route Cables: Neatly route power cables through the cable management channels of the case. Use cable ties for a clean and organized setup.

    Final Checks: Before moving on to the next step, double-check that the power supply cables are securely connected to all components.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed the power supply in your PC, providing the necessary electrical power for all components.
