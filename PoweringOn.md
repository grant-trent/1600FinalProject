# Powering On

## Step 1: Double-Check Everything

    Visual Inspection: Before powering on, conduct a final visual inspection. Ensure all components are securely installed, cables are properly connected, and there are no loose screws or obstructions.

    Verify Power Supply Switch: Check that the power supply switch is in the "on" position (I).

## Step 2: Connect Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse

    Connect Monitor: Connect your monitor to the appropriate port on the graphics card or motherboard.

    Connect Keyboard and Mouse: Connect your keyboard and mouse to the USB ports on the motherboard.

## Step 3: Power On

    Press Power Button: Press the power button on the front of the case to turn on your PC.

    Observe Lights and Fans: Pay attention to any lights on the motherboard or components and listen for the fans spinning. These indicators help confirm that power is reaching the system.

## Step 4: Check for Display

    Monitor Display: Check the monitor for a display. If your system is functioning correctly, you should see the motherboard's splash screen or a BIOS/UEFI display.

    No Display Troubleshooting: If there's no display, double-check cable connections, ensure the monitor is powered on, and consider reseating the graphics card. If the issue persists, consult your motherboard and graphics card manuals for troubleshooting steps.

## Step 5: Enter BIOS/UEFI

    Accessing BIOS/UEFI: During the initial boot, press the key (commonly DEL or F2) prompted on the screen to enter the BIOS/UEFI settings.

    Verify Components: Inside the BIOS/UEFI, verify that the system recognizes your CPU, memory, and storage devices. Ensure that the settings are correct.

## Step 6: Install Operating System

    Boot from Installation Media: Insert your operating system installation media (USB or DVD) and set the system to boot from it in the BIOS/UEFI settings.

    Follow Installation Prompts: Follow the on-screen prompts to install the operating system. Create partitions as needed and install necessary drivers.

## Step 7: Update Drivers and Software

    Install Motherboard Drivers: Download and install the latest drivers for your motherboard from the manufacturer's website.

    Install Graphics Card Drivers: Similarly, install the latest graphics card drivers from the manufacturer's website.

    Operating System Updates: Update your operating system to ensure you have the latest security patches and updates.

## Step 8: Final Checks

    Check System Temperatures: Use monitoring software to check CPU and GPU temperatures. Ensure that cooling systems are working efficiently.

    Run Stability Tests: Optionally, run stress tests to check the stability of your system. This helps identify any potential issues.

Congratulations! You've successfully powered on and set up your custom-built PC. Enjoy your personalized computing experience! If you encounter any issues, refer to your component manuals or online resources for troubleshooting assistance.
