# Storage

## Step 1: Choose and Prepare Storage Devices

    Refer to Motherboard Manual: Check the motherboard manual for information on the supported storage interfaces (SATA, NVMe, etc.) and the available storage slots.

    Select Storage Devices: Choose the storage devices you want to install, such as SSDs or HDDs, based on your storage needs and preferences.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Workspace

    Open Drive Bays: Locate the drive bays in the case where you plan to install the storage devices. These are often located in the front or back of the case.

## Step 3: Install Storage Devices
### For SATA SSDs/HDDs:

    Connect SATA Data Cable: Connect one end of the SATA data cable to the SATA port on the storage device and the other end to an available SATA port on the motherboard.

    Connect SATA Power Cable: Connect the SATA power cable from the power supply to the corresponding power connector on the storage device.

    Secure the Drive: Place the storage device in the designated drive bay and secure it using screws provided with the case.

### For M.2 NVMe SSDs:

    Locate M.2 Slot: Identify the M.2 slot on the motherboard. It's typically located near the CPU area.

    Insert the M.2 SSD: Insert the M.2 SSD into the slot at a 30-45 degree angle, then gently press it down until it is securely in place.

## Step 4: Cable Management

    Route Cables: Neatly route the SATA data and power cables to avoid clutter. Use cable ties for tidy cable management.


Congratulations! You've successfully installed the storage devices in your PC, providing the necessary space for your operating system, applications, and files. In the upcoming steps, you'll continue building your custom PC by adding the graphics card, power supply, and powering on the system.
